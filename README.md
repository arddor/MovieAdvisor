## About

The project offers a platform to search for movies by common parameters like year range, genre, specific keywords and 
the actors in the movie. The idea is to present trailers to the user rather than that he has to read all the information
himself. The intuitive user interface allows to switch easily between possibles movies and bookmark movies which are
interesting in the "hotlist". The data is provided by the popular website [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
